README:
This must be run on a machine with Python 3 installed.
For the Problem 1 and Problem 2, simply run the program by
“python Tree1.py”  for problem 1
“python Tree2.py” for problem 2
“python Tree3.py  <name of setB>” for problem 3
Please make sure Tree1(2,3).py and set_a.csv are in the same directory, I have hard code the file name for read-file, so no parameter on filename of Dataset A required on all three problems.
